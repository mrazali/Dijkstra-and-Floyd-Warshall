# Dijkstra-and-Floyd-Warshall
Implement Dijkstra and Floyd Warshall for Finding the shortest path between nodes.
->File handling use to get nodes name and path to other nodes. (file must be in txt form)
->Make Graph from that nodes info.
->Convert node info into "Matrix" if path know enter distance otherwise '0'.
->Apply Dijkstra and Floyd Warshall Algorithm.
->wtdAdjMat.cpp have main funtion.
->for example graph is impelent in file with name graph.txt


Thank you ^_^
